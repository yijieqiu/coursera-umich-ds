A pivot table is itself a data frame, where the rows represent one variable that you're interested in, the columns another, and the cell's some aggregate value. A pivot table also tends to includes *marginal values* as well, which are the *sums for each column and row*, allowing one to see the relationship between two variables at just a glance. "
